              This talk will explore the evolution and technological advancements in multimodal and crossmodal learning, including challenges, types of co-learning (parallel and non-parallel data), and multimodal fusion strategies. It will also cover the temporal aspect in multimodal data processing, with applications in emotion recognition, NLP, HCI, and robotics. Generative AI and its impact on MCMI will be highlighted, along with future directions in security and ethical considerations.
