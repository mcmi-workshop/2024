            The MCMI workshop accepts novel, previously unpublished papers that are not under review elsewhere.
            The topic of the workshop is the convergence and fusion of information from multiple modalities to allow for robust pattern recognition and understanding.
            The full list of topics of interest can be found on the <a href="submit.html#toi">Topics of Interest</a> page.
            </p>

            <h3>Submission Format</h3>

              The MCMI workshop relies on the expertise of its reviewers to ensure the quality of the papers accepted for presentation.
              First and foremost, we would like to thank all the members of the Technical Program Committee for their hard work and dedication.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              The success of our workshop heavily relies on the quality of the reviews provided. Here are some guidelines to ensure that your reviews are constructive and beneficial, even if they advise against accepting a submission.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ensure that your review is the kind you would appreciate receiving: detailed, fair, and helpful, regardless of the recommendation outcome.</li>
              <li>The focus of the MCMI conference is about the convergence and fusion of information from multiple modalities to allow for robust pattern recognition and understanding; therefore, while submissions on single media are acceptable, we particularly encourage papers that covers patterns across multiple modalities.</li>
              <li>Our conference welcomes a broad spectrum of research in multimedia analytics and modeling, not limited to the application of AI techniques. We value the richness and diversity of our research community's interests.</li>
              <li>Remember, while all reviews are to be submitted anonymously, they should be written with a level of quality that you would be proud to claim as your own.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">
              Some additional guidelines to consider when reviewing papers for MCMI:
            </p>
            <h3>Check the Paper Topic</h3>
            <hr>
            <ul>
              <li>Ensure that the paper you are reviewing aligns with the thematic scope of MCMI, as outlined in the Call for Papers. Your judgment and collective wisdom with your peers are essential in determining if the paper fits the cross-modal interaction and pattern recognition topics.</li>
              <li>Keep in mind that the issues addressed in an MCMI paper ideally involve multi-modal or cross-modal data, focusing on the challenges associated with how these complex data types are interpreted and utilized in pattern recognition.</li>
              <li>While many submissions to MCMI might showcase technical contributions such as new algorithms or AI applications, this is not a strict requirement. Papers that explore new problems in multi and cross-modal interactions should be evaluated on the novelty of their insights and their potential impact on the field, rather than just their technical innovation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Support Your Statements</h3>
            <hr>
            <ul>
              <li>Reviews should not just assert common knowledge with phrases like “It is well known that…”. Instead, they should substantiate such claims with appropriate citations. Similarly, instead of vaguely stating “Important references are missing…”, reviews should provide specific examples.</li>
              <li>Reviewers should only list their own work as references in exceptional cases when these works are directly relevant and critical for the authors to consider.</li>
              <li>Reviews should not merely suggest comparing to the state of the art. Instead, they should reference specific peer-reviewed work, explaining why it is relevant and should have been considered by the authors.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Respect the Authors</h3>
            <hr>
            <ul>
              <li>Reviews should focus on critiquing the paper, not the authors themselves.</li>
              <li>Reviews should avoid addressing the authors directly, especially not using “you”, to prevent any perception of personal criticism.</li>
              <li>Reviewers should not attempt to deduce the identity of the authors during the review process.</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- <h3>Please Include in Your Review</h3>
            <hr>
            <ul>
              <li>Statement of novelty: What does the paper contribute to the field of multi and cross-modal interaction and pattern recognition? Is this contribution significant? Does the paper thoroughly cover relevant related work and articulate how its contributions build upon or diverge from these works?</li>
              <li>Statement of scientific rigor: Are the methodologies and experiments robust and well-designed? Do they convincingly support the paper’s claims? Are the findings reproducible? Have any resources like datasets or code been provided?</li>
              <li>Recommendations for the final version: Minor errors can be trusted to be corrected by the authors, who will likely commit to such corrections during the rebuttal phase. Major flaws, however, must lead to rejection unless convincingly rectified, as there is no subsequent verification by the reviewers.</li>
            </ul> -->
            <h3>Policy on arXiv Papers</h3>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              For the purposes of this workshop, a publication is considered to be a document that has been peer-reviewed and accepted. Thus, the following applies to arXiv papers and other similar non-peer-reviewed publications. If the paper under review is available on arXiv and has not been officially published elsewhere, it qualifies as an acceptable submission for the workshop.
            </p>
